# Amazon Japan Logistics (AMZL) Program Manager Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Program Management Dashboard** designed specifically for the **Amazon Logistics (AMZL) Team** in Japan. It serves as a technical portfolio piece for the 2027/2028 Graduate Program Manager Internship.

## Major Problem Resolved
In complex logistics networks like AMZL, Program Managers face the challenge of **fragmented data and manual capacity planning**. This project resolves three major pain points:
1.  **Manual Simulation**: Replaces manual spreadsheets with a **Dynamic Capacity Planning Simulator** to visualize how volume spikes impact On-The-Road (OTR) performance.
2.  **Lack of Visibility**: Consolidates PMO project tracking, partner performance, and operational metrics (OTR %, Delivery Speed) into a single source of truth.
3.  **Standardization Gap**: Provides a standardized PMO interface for tracking AMZL-specific workstreams like "Ultrafast 2-hour Delivery" and "Launch & Execution."

## Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI (Shadcn) for a professional Amazon-corporate aesthetic.
-   **Data Visualization**: Recharts for high-performance operational metrics and capacity utilization bars.
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express providing a RESTful API.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for robust data management and type safety.
-   **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient data fetching and caching.

## Key Features for the Interview
-   **OTR Capacity Simulator**: Demonstrates the ability to "Develop simulation models" as requested in the job description.
-   **AMZL Workstream Tracking**: Aligns directly with the PMO responsibilities (Standardization, Follow-up tracking).
-   **Partner Metrics Table**: Highlights the "Launch and Execution" requirement for overseeing partner delivery services and volume forecasting.
